                <h4>WHY I DECIDED TO STUDY SOFTWARE ENGINEERING.</h4>
                <h5>12th of July, 2021</h5>
            </div>
            <p>Long story short, I was looking for a change. Change of career, change of lifestyle, to change my life.
                For the first time in my life I was in a place where I could see a future and so I made my first ever 5
                year plan. Part of that plan was moving my income online.
            <p>But big picture, what was I looking for? Freedom. It's always been about freedom. The freedom to be
                wherever I want or need to be without compromising my ability to work. Being free to explore a variety
                of job prospects. The freedom to create without the constraints of a website builder. The freedom that a
                reliable source of income can provide.
            <p>Now don't get me wrong, I love my job. It can be rewarding, and it enables me to explore whatever
                creative avenues interest me. It has helped me travel the world and enjoy things I never could have
                dreamed of. And the free time! The free time it provided was wonderful for a while. It allowed me to
                grow as a person and explore things I never would have been able to without it but I wanted more. It was
                getting to the point that I NEEDED more. I wasn't growing anymore. I'd stagnated.
            <p>I'd tried everything. I started up home businesses. Distracted myself with cute animals or learning
                languages. I picked up every hobby under the sun (most of which I loved and still enjoy from time to
                time) but it wasn't enough. I realised all I was doing was killing time. That wasn't what I wanted so
                nothing ever satisfied. What I needed was a whole new career. But what was going to interest me long
                term and not just become another thing I dropped when I realise it's not scratching that itch.
            <p>It had to be something I already had a proven interest in. There are two things that I truly love to do
                \\ and have done so for more than 6 years now. Firstly, I love to create and execute photoshoots.
                Alternatively, I also love designing and building websites on Wix. The former can't be moved solely
                online and has limited job prospects so I decided to look into a career in coding.
                \\ I would spend every free moment on it until there's nothing left for me to do and then I'd find way
                to make more work for myself just so there was more to do.
            <p>… A booming industry with no sign of slowing down. … It ticked all my boxes: the ability to work from
                home, check; a desire to always be learning, check; open the door for more opportunities, check check
                and check! Best of all was the entry point. I didn't need prior work experience or a flush resume. I
                just needed to prove my knowledge and one thing I know about myself is I love to learn.
                \But how do I ensure that I will stick with it.\
            <p>In the past I've dabbled in various coding apps but never really got far. Not for a lack of interest or
                enjoyment/satisfaction. I needed deadlines. People to hold me accountable. A goal to aim for. So I
                decided to check out Software Engineering courses and stumbled across Academy xi. One call with a Course
                Advisor and I was sold. Seemingly rashly, as a lot of my big life decisions must be, I signed up that
                day.
            <p>That was 2 months ago. Now I'm almost two weeks in and so far I love it! I've found the experience to be
                so incredibly rewarding and I've barely even begun. We've just begun to cover front end languages,
                beginning with HTML, then CSS and now JavaScript. It's been so satisfying to begin with languages that
                show me the immediate result of my progress. I've spent every second of my free time exploring the
                nuances of these languages (just like when I get stuck doing something I love!). I've successfully found
                another thing to be passionate about and even better, I can get paid to do it!
            <p>Now that I've found a new passion I plan to develop and hone my skills, particularly for front-end
                languages but I'm also interested in developing an understanding of Python, C++ and Ruby amongst many
                other things.
            <p>This experience has reinvigorated my love for learning and joie de vivre. Not only am I \happy\ and
                motivated to jump out of bed each day but I'm enjoying my spare time so much more. It's now something to
                cherish and not just seen as time to kill. I feel so fulfilled and I'm barely scratching the surface of
                2.5 languages.
